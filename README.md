ctags-elixir
============

Exuberant CTags support for the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) language.

To enable:
----------

Copy or append this `.ctags` file to your own `~/.ctags`.

Once you have done that, you can build tags for an Elixir app with the usual
ctags command line: cd into your project, and then

```sh
ctags -R .
```

Feedback
--------

Feedback is more than welcome; I'm new to the Elixir language, so I
probably got some things wrong.
